### ✨ A Primer on Bonding

TwzFinance does everything a bit different. Thus, it should be no surprise that our LP rewards are unconventional. 
They are designed to both incentivize and lock liquidity by offering an attractive risk/reward profile, and they should introduce an interesting and net beneficial dynamic into the $ZONE market. 

So, how do they work?

### Overview

Bonding is the process of trading an LP share to the protocol for ZONE. The protocol quotes an amount of ZONE and a vesting period for the trade. 
It is important to know: when you create your bond, you are giving up your LP share. The protocol compensates you with more ZONE than you’d get on the market, 
but your exposure becomes entirely to ZONE and no longer to ZONE-ALPHA LP.

### Creating a bond

To create a bond, you must first add liquidity to the ZONE-ALPHA AlphaSwap pool. You’ll then go to our website and select “Bond.” The protocol will quote a price for you. 
If you accept, you then send your LP share to the treasury and receive a claim on ZONE.


### Claiming a Bond

To claim a bond, you’ll go to our website and select “claim bond.” The protocol will recall when you bonded and your vesting term. If you have any pending rewards, you can claim them. 
Rewards accrue throughout the vesting period.

### I’ve Claimed My Bond…Now What?

Go stake that ZONE! When you bond, you receive ZONE. You can either sell them (boooooo), you can stake them to earn TWLT (Twilight), or you can bond them again.
Note that TWLT (Twilight) is the protocol’s profit accruing token and since bonders earn ZONE (not TWLT), stakers earn 100% of protocol profits (minus the DAO’s cut). See our [docs](https://docs.TwilightZone.finance) for more info.

### Why Do I Want to Bond?

Because it allows you to buy ZONE at a lower cost basis. In return for selling your LP, the protocol will sell you ZONE at a discount.

This means a bonder is (generally) selling their LP for below market value. However, this is canceled out by the protocol bonding ZONE at below market value.

The exponential increase in the value of bonded ZONE relative to the value of the LP is expected to create increasing demand for bonds the higher price is.
This is an extremely favorable dynamic; the higher price goes (and the more the protocol sells in response), the more liquidity there should be.
Bonders can make this trade, despite the risk, because their breakeven point has been reduced. The higher the price is, the greater that padding becomes.

This trade only makes sense when ZONE trades for a premium. 
At a discount, it actually results in a higher breakeven than simply buying on the market. This is favorable because we want more liquidity at premiums (to hold that premium) and less liquidity at discounts (to force supply to sell at lower prices and to more easily recover). 
To compound this dynamic, the protocol will remove portions of the LP that it holds when price trades below IV, burning the ZONE and depositing the KCS into the treasury.

### Conclusion

This is how we will incentivize users to provide liquidity. We expect it to:

- Permanently lock significant amounts of liquidity
- Positively correlate liquidity with price
- Lengthen premiums and shorten discounts
- Increase participation by introducing a second dominant strategy with a completely different risk profile (compared to buy and stake)
- Increase protocol profits by adding a second mechanism to burn ZONE (pulling LP)
- Pad the treasury balance sheet by marking the value of LP shares at equilibrium (they’re worth more than that any time price != FMV).
- Help grow TwzFinance!
